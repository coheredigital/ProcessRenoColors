# ProcessRenoColors

A small module I put together to allow easy control over the colors used in the popular Reno admin theme (and a few other convenient tweaks). This is helpful when you find yourself jumping between multiple sites using the same admin theme, the addition of more distinct visual separation can help anchor which site you are currently working on.
